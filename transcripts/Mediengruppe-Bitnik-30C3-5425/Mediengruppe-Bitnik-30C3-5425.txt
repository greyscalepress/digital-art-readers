                Mediengruppe Bitnik: Hacking as Artistic Practice



  Carmen:           Hello. Good evening. Thank you for having us here.

                    It is a great pleasure to be here.

                    We are Mediengruppe Bitnik. An artist group from Zurich.

                    My name is Carmen. This is Domagoj. We would like to talk about our
                    artistic work.

                    Our work deals a lot with public spaces and the possibilities of
                    publics. Our practice is very explorative and interventionist. You
                    could say our main artistic practices is hacking. We take hacking
                    from computer culture and transfer it to, or into our, art
                    practice.

                    Instead of trying to explain what we do in theory, we'll show you
                    two of our works.

                    The first is called "Opera Calling". It's an older work, it's from
                    2007, and we produced it in collaboration with Cabaret Voltaire,
                    which is a Dadaistic outspace in Zurich. It's an outspace which is
                    in the house where Dada was founded a hundred years ago, in Zurich.

                    We started out this work from a curiosity about opera in general,
                    as an art form, but also the Zurich Opera House.

                    Coming from digital culture and the collaborative practices of the
                    Internet, opera is a very strange art form. It's very closed. You
                    need to be dressed in a certain way to go there. You need to go
                    there in person, there's no way of participating otherwise. The
                    fees are quite high, so you need some money also to get in. This
                    led to this project.

  Domagoj:          To give you a little bit more of a local context. So, 85 percent of
                    all the cultural budgets of the Canton of Zurich goes directly to
                    this House. The remaining 15 percent are shared by all other art
                    forms; dance, theater, museums, fine art spaces, whatever, 15
                    percent vs. 85.

                    At the beginning of the '80s in Zurich, youth riots started in
                    front of the Opera House. There was youth demanding space for self-
                    organized youth culture and a little bit of money. If you talk
                    about opera in Zurich, everybody knows about those true
                    backgrounds. They always resonate somehow.

                    We asked ourselves, how can we open up this closed system of the
                    Zurich Opera House? How can we become part of the opera audience
                    without actually going there?

  Carmen:           In our research we stumbled across this very beautiful image, it
                    shows the forgotten use of the telephone from the outgoing
                    nineteenth century. Right off when the telephone was invented,
                    companies started to try to sell the media, but they couldn't say
                    "buy yourself a phone and wait for a while and maybe somebody else
                    will buy one in your neighborhood and then you can call each
                    other."

                    What they did was that they connected whatever local cultural
                    institutions they had up to the telephone network. You had
                    something called "Teatro-phone" or the "Opera-phone" in Paris. This
                    was in place until the radio was invented.

                    The telephone was used as a radio up until the invention of the
                    radio. You see here on the right, the opera singer in front of her
                    microphones on the stage, in the center you see the telephone
                    switchboards.

                    The family at home receiving this opera transmission in front of
                    the telephone. The telephone doesn't have a receiver like we know
                    it today, it's more gramophone loudspeaker, so it was really used
                    as a sort of wall telephone.

  Domagoj:          This was one of the first uses of live transmission of something,
                    so it was super strange for people to experience something which is
                    not happening in the same room.

  Carmen:           We really liked this, and we asked ourselves what would happen if
                    we would recreate the service as a public service nobody had asked
                    for, a hundred years later.

  Domagoj:          So instead of using these microphones, we decided to install box,
                    like audio box, hidden microphones inside the opera house. We had
                    an exhibition space in the café Voltaire which would get the live
                    audio feed out of the opera, and there we had the telephone server
                    running, connecting local households in Zurich, just like calling
                    them.

                    There was a random generator scanning through the telephone book of
                    Zurich, randomly picking one number and saying "Hey, here's the
                    live opera. If you want to hear it, just stay connected. Beep, and
                    here it is!"

  Carmen:           This is the auditorium of the Opera House. We quickly found out
                    it's not a good place to place the box. You need to place them
                    behind the stage so they stay there a lot longer.

  Domagoj:          This is a screenshot from a newspaper on Swiss Television. In the
                    picture you see the director of the Zürich Opera House showing one
                    of those boxes they found live on telly. They were expecting the
                    box to be James Bond-like devices. They were really surprised that
                    we just used normal mobile phones that we could call in and they
                    would pick up automatically and give us something like an audio
                    feed.

                    They were not happy about this project going on. We received a
                    really harsh letter saying we should immediately remove all the
                    boxes. They gave us two days, or they would call the military
                    service to debug, or I don't know what the word is, to debug the
                    Opera House and we would have to pay the fee.

                    The letter also said they would sue us for Copyright Infringement,
                    while at the same time the Opera Singers Union wanted to sue us for
                    Transmission Fees -- normally you have to pay something if you
                    broadcast -- and for libel, because of the bad audio quality.
                    "People could think within this telephone transmission we sound so
                    badly we can't sing". These were the effects.

  Carmen:           This is the bug, what it looked like, when it was not being
                    unwrapped by the director of the Opera House.

  Domagoj:          Really cheaply made, like gaffer tape and an external microphone
                    for a little bit better audio quality. It was taped so if you
                    called the mobile phone, the display wouldn't leak up. We could
                    produce it really fast.

  Carmen:           This was the telephone machine at the exhibition space, in the
                    Cabaret Voltaire. This was the only place where you could listen to
                    the work without having to receive the call at home. So you could
                    come here and listen in on the opera world that the service was
                    running

  Domagoj:          We produced a small film, it's one call showing a family receiving
                    this strange opera telephone. It's Sunday afternoon in March 25th,
                    we'll just listen in for a few minutes so you get a little bit of
                    context of what it was about. It's a black screen with subtitles,
                    goes for another four minutes, it's a beautiful piece.

                    [applause]

                    I am going to try to find out which opera is playing, a kid will
                    join in, and they will explain what the opera is and blah blah
                    blah. They're really excited, it goes for about eight minutes. It's
                    on our website if you want to check it.

  Carmen:           As you saw before, and the woman already explained, the media
                    picked up heavily on the project locally. There was a big
                    discussion about who owns publicly funded culture, who has access.
                    It went back and forth for a while, also the legal battle between
                    the Opera House and us, and the Cabaret Voltaire, because the media
                    also made it into this David against Goliath story where the small,
                    poor artist against this subsidized Opera House, they sort of
                    accepted the work as an enhancement of their performance
                    repertoire.

                    It ran for three months, we transmitted every performance every
                    night, from the Opera House. So we re-transmitted about 100 hours
                    of Opera to about 100 hours of opera to around 4,500 households in
                    Zurich.

                    The second work we would like to talk about is a very recent work.
                    It's called "Delivery for Mr. Assange." We produced it in January
                    this year. About 11 months ago.

                    The starting point for this work was our interest in the
                    circumstances under which Julian Assange has been living at the
                    Ecuadorian embassy in London since seeking asylum in June 2012.

                    The embassy was surrounded by British police in August 2012, around
                    the time the embassy announced they would grant Julian Assange
                    asylum.

                    For us, this very strange setting in the heart of London, in the
                    very touristic area of Western London, became the sign of a global
                    diplomatic crisis going on between the powers that be and Internet
                    aficionados, transparency people, and Julian Assange.

  Domagoj:          Normally you don't see this kind of conflict. It's something which
                    shows itself in the media or Internet, but it manifests itself in
                    this touristic area west of London. You pass all those people when
                    you get nearby.

                    There are many tourists, and suddenly you are in front of this
                    police barrier. They have these strange police cars and vans with
                    strange antennas. You really feel the conflict physically. I would
                    say it's a war zone. You entered there and you feel it. It's a war
                    zone.

                    We asked ourselves, how can we intervene into this geopolitical
                    situation where both sides are not really moving anymore.

                    Six months, there's dozens of police outside, Assange is inside.
                    [cough]

                    We asked ourselves which communications channels into the
                    Ecuadorian embassy are still open, physically or so. We knew we
                    can't just go there and walk in by ourselves. We started to analyze
                    the situation, and one question was, what happens if we introduce a
                    bit of normality into these exceptional circumstances.

                    We realized the postal system could be an interesting tool to test
                    the situation. Sending a parcel is an everyday act. But
                    what happens when you send a parcel to Julian Assange?

  Carmen:           We built a parcel. We wanted better feedback than just going to the
                    post office and posting it. We made a hole into the side of the
                    parcel, and behind the hole is a camera which takes a picture every
                    10-15 seconds and uploads the image to our server. We really had a
                    parcel with a live tracking image system.

                    We addressed it to Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in
                    London. We basically wanted to see if the parcel would reach him.
                    Would it be opened? Would it be removed from this postal system? In
                    a sense it was like a real world ping, or a trace route, or a
                    system test we called it inserted into a highly tense diplomatic
                    crisis.

  Domagoj:          We also published this picture showing the parcel, what it looks
                    like when it's scanned by an X-Ray machine. We published it on the
                    same website where the live feed was. We have this strange device
                    here, something here, and a battery block on the side.

  Carmen:           The outcome of the experiment was totally open, equally for us. As
                    for anyone watching online, this is something we really like about
                    art. It holds this opportunity for an intentional loss of control.
                    You create an intervention and you just wait for some feedback. In
                    this case it was waiting for images. This was the website where the
                    images arrived every 10-15 seconds.

  Domagoj:          This would reload.

  Carmen:           You would have a reload here.

  Domagoj:          Maybe we have to say there was also a GPS inside. We had the GPS
                    position live and this image stream.

  Carmen:           We tried to contextualize what was going on with these images. You
                    could watch the live feed uncommented, or on the website you could
                    see a stream of images we posted with comments to help figure out
                    what was happening to the parcel. We also posted these images on
                    Twitter.

                    The first image shows Domagoj queuing up. You can see him in the
                    mirror a bit there at a post office in East London. We only tested
                    the British Royal Mail System, no borders.

                    Queuing up. He's next. Approaching the counter. The parcel was
                    accepted. This was the first fear we had, that the person at the
                    post office would say, Oh sorry, this has a hole. I'm not going to
                    accept this.

  Domagoj:          Or maybe they would tape the hole or something. When it made it
                    behind this glass thing and disappeared in this bag it was
                    accepted.

                    We received these red images for quite a long time. You would sit
                    there and it was a really slow stream. You felt like 1995 maybe.
                    Every 15 seconds, one picture. Sometimes they were broken so they
                    were not good. Really, really slow.

  Carmen:           The parcel just sat there for a while at this post office, we
                    assume in this bag. Then it went dark. Of course we already got
                    very nervous. Has somebody taped the camera?

  Domagoj:          Did they find it out? We didn't know. Still black. One hour later,
                    still black. Receiving one every 15 seconds.

  Carmen:           Now the parcel was moving, or being moved, which we saw through the
                    GPS locations.

  Domagoj:          At 6:00, after three hours of black images, this image appeared. It
                    seemed we just had no light. Everything was fine, we are alive.
                    Let's go on.

  Carmen:           We saw through the GPS locations that we had arrived at something
                    called Mount Pleasant Mail Center in Central London.

  Domagoj:          Suddenly, this view. For the first time, we left this box and we
                    had this voyeuristic view of something you wouldn't see normally.
                    So you post something, it disappears, and then it comes out again,
                    somewhere else.

  Carmen:           We also called this "unmanned photography". You always get very
                    strange images, trolleys, feet.

  Domagoj:          It's 9:00. People pushing trolleys, workers, still dark. Then we
                    will disappear in a green bag.

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          It's red, green.

  Carmen:           People online started participating also, trying to find out what
                    was happening to the parcel. They helped us interpret studio
                    locations, images. After four hours into the performance, our
                    service went offline from the many requests. People started setting
                    up mirrors, started writing scripts to get all the images from our
                    server because they were properly afraid that they would go away or
                    be lost.

  Domagoj:          So at around 11:00, almost 12 hours since posting, we realized, we
                    are on our way out of town. It was really strange because we are
                    here, Julian Assange is here. The parcel just passed us and goes
                    here. What the fuck? I'm like, where is it heading to? So it wasn't
                    really sure, and it was moving fast. Black, black, black for hours,
                    11:00, parcel's not moving anymore.

  Carmen:           And here we arrived near Heathrow Airport at the Royal Jubilee Mail
                    Center, that's 22 kilometers west of the city.

  Domagoj:          Then again you have people working, trolleys, 2:00 in the morning,
                    dominant color yellow, silent observer, trolley on the move again,
                    and then black again. Black. So black since 1:30, it was almost
                    5:00 in the morning.

  Carmen:           Then moving back into the city at half past five, I think we're at
                    South London Mail Center now. We'll see in a moment - yes. And the
                    parcel was always taken out of the bag, which was really nice for
                    our work.

  Domagoj:          So we are at around 9:00, we were moving near central London, we
                    were not sure but optimistic. Maybe a postman will take it and
                    bring it to Assange. So at 10:00 we started to move around, really
                    near the Ecuadorean Embassy.

  Carmen:           We moved very slowly, so we thought maybe we're on the delivery
                    route now, maybe it's the stop-and-go movement of a van. Always
                    stopping to take out stuff. We could see other mail, but we could
                    never see the van itself so we weren't really sure.

  Domagoj:          Around this time, a BBC article went up and our server went down
                    again, so it was like immediately a reaction on it. At 12:00, still
                    moving near the Embassy, getting nearer. We were waiting for two
                    hours, basically to be delivered.

  Carmen:           People online were writing "hey bitnik, when will this parcel be
                    delivered, because I really need to get some work done."

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          Or "hurry up Bitnik, no one is working at my office, parcel already
                    ruined my morning. I've been watching this for 24 hours, I'm
                    exhausted."

  Carmen:           We were also exhausted.

  Domagoj:          We didn't sleep the night before to get this thing done. So then...

  Carmen:           We started seeing houses, so we were quite sure we were in the van.

                    [crosstalk]

  Domagoj:          The van...

  Carmen:           Nearly empty .

  Domagoj:          It's about us now, no?

                    [laughter]

  Carmen:           Then the other post comes and we were like, oh my god, we're being
                    taken back to the delivery center.

  Domagoj:          Then at around 2:00 we were seeing these strange images and I'm
                    like, we are in front of the Ecuadorean Embassy. It's just about to
                    pass this police border, but we didn't really know what was going
                    on here. Something like a full delivery folder, a delivery list.
                    Some things from inside maybe. We think we are in front of the
                    Embassy now, image is still black. Waiting for delivery. Still
                    nothing happening.

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          Diplomatic crisis. Or is the postman just taking lunch break? Four
                    hours. Then, at 2:00, you don't see it really well here, it's about
                    small changes in the image. Here we could see something like a
                    floor. The floor is like...

  Carmen:           A wooden floor.

  Domagoj:          We are somewhere inside. We are not outside anymore, we are
                    somewhere inside.

  Carmen:           We assumed we had been delivered to the Embassy, and now got
                    confirmation at ten to 3:00.

  Domagoj:          So we are quickly writing on Twitter, "bitnik package has arrived,
                    is now with Embassy security," and we're like - yeah we made it
                    inside the Embassy, has delivered the parcel, WikiLeaks confirms
                    parcel is still in darkness, we are waiting. Still nothing for 90
                    minutes. The parcel has transmitted over 9000 images, most of them
                    are black.

  Carmen:           Somebody immediately wrote...

  Domagoj:          "This is not true."

  Carmen:           10,000 images and maybe 34 percent are black.

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          We're like, OK, you do the analysis for us. So it went on for some
                    hours again, then at 4:30 we'd see strange images like this, are we
                    on a sofa? Battery time would get critical when we had like 30
                    hours, 26 hours passed, so it's about four or five hours left. We
                    don't know. So then at 6:00, this pic. Everybody was like "wow", it
                    looks really official, no? We got this tweet from a journalist from
                    South America saying she knows this is inside the Embassy. She was
                    there, and this is the waiting room.

                    [applause]

  Domagoj:          But it went dark again. We're like "oh fuck! Come on!" So somebody
                    switched on the lights, and switched it off again. Our camera took
                    two or three pictures and the suspense is mounting. Some movement.
                    We saw strange colors some minutes later. We're like "what the fuck
                    is happening now?" Red colors, stripes, something fluffy? What is
                    it?

                    [laughter]

  Carmen:           We thought it was a dog, but it was a cat. Twitter was going, "it's
                    a cat!"

  Domagoj:          Is it a dog barking? "It's a cat! It's a cat!" but we just didn't
                    see the messages because we were heavy uploading stuff like
                    manually to Twitter, because our website was not accessible
                    anymore. Or it might be a cat. The question - has Julian Assange
                    taken over? Is he playing with us? Then we received this message.
                    "Is this thing on?"

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          We are like, "Hello Julian, yes, we are here!" Back to black.
                    Tiger.

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          More. Hello, world.

                    [applause]

  Domagoj:          So you know the term, love is contagious? Handwritten messages. It
                    was a tour around Ecuador. Welcome to Ecuador.

                    [laughter]

  Domagoj:          Welcome to Ecuador.

                    [applause]

  Domagoj:          Nabeel Rajab, human rights activist in Bahrain, he is in prison.
                    Free Anakata, one of the founders of The Pirate Bay, he was in

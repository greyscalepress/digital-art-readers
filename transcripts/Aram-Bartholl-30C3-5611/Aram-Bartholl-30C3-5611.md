## Hello World!
### How to make art after Snowden?
 
Talk #5611

Aram Bartholl:  Thanks for the introduction, and also thanks for having me talking here today. It’s quite a pleasure and an honor. I’ve been coming to this event for many years already. I’ve been doing stuff here over the years, so you might recognize this or the other project.

I came to Berlin in the mid ’90s and I studied architecture at the UdK, the University of Arts in Berlin. I think ’97 or ’98, the congress moved to Berlin from here. It’s like a stepping stone, an important influence to my artistic career. 

In art school, in architecture, we were still trained to draw ink plans, while there was the Web and Internet coming up.

I went over to the technical campus to write emails to one friend I knew who had an email address, in Hamburg. It was way more interesting to design a house, and then to load it into some game, and play in there, instead of drawing by ink. I was always torn inbetween, learning this very old craft, and at the same time there was something super interesting happening.

There is always this moment, probably you all know ... we did tons of projects, lots of 3D lots of video stuff, et cetera. We were quite free to do what we wanted to do. Then I had this moment when I lost burned CD roms. You lose data because your laptop get stolen, or the backup is not working, and suddenly – "wow, where’s all this projectds. Where is the beauty I made, all the 3D stuff?". 

I developed that need to make these things tangible and touchable again. This is one big part of my artistic practice, or my main mission -- to discuss this online off‑line relationship. 

I’m going to show some very classic projects you might have seen online at some point. Then I will go more to CCC related and more to the fun stuff, later on.

Now, the typical projects ‑‑ this is called "Map". It’s about Google Maps, and it’s about this Google Map marker here in the middle. I started this in 2006. It’s an interface object. It’s sitting on the screen, when you zoom in, it stays at the same pixel size, but it casts a shadow at the same time. The more you zoom in, the more it becomes part of the city.

I started to make these in 2006, where it was really still... This "blurring boundary" discussion kind of started. For me, it was very important. I’ve been showing this project a lot over the past seven, eight years. Here in Taiwan, Taipei, or in France two years ago. It’s very much about this irritating moment, like "Oh, yeah. I know this icon very well. But wait a second -- what is it doing here?"

We are very used to all these tools, to be online. At the same time, we are still humans made of flesh, and walk in the city. There are different rules going on there. I like to break inbetween these boundaries. Today this piece for me is already historical, in the sense that we overcame that point a long time ago already. Especially here with you guys.

This is the recent set up in Kassel, where I had a show in September, October. Google is not building these markers, right? But they are super important in occupying that location, this whole location story, with Search, et cetera. 

I think it’s just a question of time until they will enter billboard marketing with face recognition. I read somewhere in England, this is already coming, the camera on top having targeted you. The step into the physical is coming in a different way, but it represents how important it is here. 

All these markers in these cases, it’s always the city center. When you Google for Hamburg, I don’t know what pops up here. But I always have the goal to put it exactly at the place where Google claims the city center to be.

"Wow, yeah. Is this the city center?" Some programmer put it there, because the name is there. Sometimes it’s in a main square, but not always.

## Dust ##

(5:30)

I played a lot of computer games. I grew up with computer games. This is a counter‑strike map, called "Dust". It's the last game I really played excessively, 10 years ago, or more than 10 years ago. What I liked very much about these games, compared to movies, when you look at them, you need to know the map and the architecture very, very well to survive in there. 

It’s not like a movie where you talk about the same atmosphere, or scenes, or what happened with the plot. The plot, itself, in this this kind of first‑person shooter game, there is no plot. It’s just fighting each other. 

But the architecture, and the space itself, unfolds as a plot. When you’ve ever played one of these games, you will always recognize the space, and you will know exactly what’s right behind that door on the right. Just to survive in there, it’s super crucial to know the map by heart.

As humans, also, we are trained to remember space. I still have trouble in this building here, with all the stairs. I kind of get it with the two big rooms next to each other. But we got lost here, or on the airport you pass every once a while. But here, you would never get lost, if you’ve played it.

I think the gamers, really early on, they realized that shift. They made this connection: "Wow, look, we can sit on top of each other in the game. What is it like to do this in real life? It doesn’t make sense for a SEALS team, but well, let’s do it." 

It’s the same point, also here, you have the "Dusk" man from above, aerial view. And then, I found these pictures on the Web.

(picture: map in the sand)

They would just rebuild the map in the sand on the beach. Not because they had a print‑out, but because they know it by heart. 

I’ve been dealing with this map over a long time. Also, "Dust" map and counter‑strike is kind of legendary. This is a scale of 1:1 model for a show in Kassel.

To enter the show, you needed to pass that crucial door. And, if you played that game, you know, it’s this line of sight in the middle. 

I’ve been experimenting also in other ways. Here you see the section of one of these gates. 

In August, I had a show in public in Sheerbroke, in Canada, near to Montreal. We were building 20 of these crates that are positioned in the space of that map, in an old prison yard. A prison yard from the 19th Century, and it did fit super well, because it’s like this closed space, with the sky.

((images))

You get an idea, like here: the gate is just cardboard, but it’s very precise 1:1. Here are just the crates, taken from the game. And, also, they are pixelized. You get an idea from far away, but when you look closer, you really see it. 

I also did 3D prints of the prototypes of the whole map, and one of my far goals would be...

I mean, how many people have been in Hamburg? How many people have been in important places in the world, in, I don’t know, Times Square or Mecca? And how many people have been in here? A lot of people have been in here!

I claim it's cultural heritage. It should be, why not, having this built as a museum/real life sculpture. This is a very far goal, and it would be very big to build, 100x120 meters.

I would love to see this, and not only from cardboard, but from concrete. And maybe it’s going to be like a pilgrim place for the gamers, and in 200 years, people will think like, "What is this, some funny cultural artifact?" 

I made some first tests on how to build this. And if course, this looks more like Minecraft, right?

### WoW ###

(09:42)

Another project from the game section, World of Warcraft -- you probably all know this game very well. What is interesting in this screenshot is that the party who just killed the dragon in the back, they’re taking a group picture, because the moment is so important. They spent so many hours on achieving that goal, and they know each other very well -- over the Internet.
For people not being in these worlds, it’s really hard to understand what’s going on and how close these relationships grow online. I love this as a reference. When you go to travel with a group, you take a group picture. And here, they take a group picture.

I got interested in these name markers, which are very common, in all 3D games, in any other online world. There's a workshop I’ve been doing quite a lot of time. Here, this was the last time in the Laguna Museum in California, two, three years ago. Everybody builds their own real name from cardboard and then, we mount them on plastic strips. And then, we walk our names in the city, as if we were MMO.

[applause]

Aram:  This is - in 2007, I think I started this. We’re going to have this tomorrow, with Google Glass. Let’s say, the data is there. We all know now the data is there and they can put names all the time, over our heads. They will probably try not to put these names in the first place, because this is always the scary moment -- the face recognition, and people will freak out.

But we know the data is there. 

Seven years ago, in 2007, this was fun. Now it’s becoming sort of creepy, a little bit. Also, it’s interesting to think about how 10 years ago, there was no reason to put your name online. Today, when you’re not, "cannot be found by name online", you might be a terrorist. 

And at the same time in the city, in a public space, I can walk up to someone and get to know someone and ask for their name... but you don’t walk your name, in public. It’s a private thing.

So it’s a beautiful experiment, also, for the group and then, we walk each other, our names, so it’s this little play going on. We had a lot of fun on that beach here on a Saturday afternoon. 

I know I’ve been doing this in different countries, also. It’s very interesting. When you do this in Germany and Berlin, it’s like, "Oh, yeah, that’s an art project." In the US, there were people like, "Oh, is like advertising for a political party?"
And here, this is in Seoul in South Korea, in a student quarter, and people would just yell their name through the whole street, super loud. So the reaction to this is very different from where you do it. 

It’s interesting, also, combined to the online worlds. People strip naked online all the time, but you don’t do it in public. There’s this gap developed. Of course, things change now, when there’s always all these Facebook comments, then, people behave more, et cetera. But it is very different spaces, and at the same time, this online/offline -- there’s always the name pair of analog/digital -- it’s so much involving into each other. We cannot make a separation anymore. 

But at the same time, well, it’s a difference still if you talk face‑to‑face or if you chat online. 

Now, we come to the next project.

### Chat ###

It’s about chatting. Here, again, World of Warcraft, plus many other games. To chat online, it’s like a super old communication channel. It has also very specific qualities, it's a very narrow channel, people can be talking of what they wouldn’t say face‑to‑face, et cetera. 

So, what would it be like to chat in real life? I made these two speech bubbles that have a backlight projection in the back.

The people barring the keyboard can type into the speech bubble, and it will appear, just above your head. What is this like? It’s the same thing, again, what the NSA knows of the data. They could put the speech bubble to our head. 

But when you order a drink in a Club Transmediale party here at the bar, you would immediately get it, because it’s really big.

It also stays there for 20 seconds, so people can read the message much longer. When you sit next to a table, people talking, you might hear parts of the conversation, but written words, we all know, it’s way more static. You can always go back and find out what people said. 

This project was also a part of the Congress, in 2007. I beta tested it here, we had a lot of fun. You might know this guy. Also, Bre Pettis was here in this year. "Hello, hackers", "break the system." "I hope you’re here somewhere". This was a lot of fun. 

It was, also, used by the FoeBud, today called Digital Courage for actions in public space, about RFID chips in fashion.

### Are you human? ###

Part of this project came from here and, also, I will talk about this in the end. Now, there’s another branch, also, Internet related, but no 3D, no games. 

*Are You Human?* is about captcha codes. We all know this technology of captcha code, completely automated Turing tests to tell humans and computers apart. It’s this annoying little JPEG at the bottom there.

It’s that moment where the script and the server are asking you, "Are you human? Can you prove to me that you’re human?" to prevent spamming. But it’s interesting that the Turing test used to be you sitting in front of the screen deciding if you’re talking to a human or to a computer.

Now it’s the software deciding on you, right? 

These are old ones. This is, also, captchas from 2007. They’ve changed over the years. There are all these different, like sound captchas, and Google Street View of house number captchas.

It describes very well that the moment where we are at. How machines and software and computers... Wow, it’s difficult to say this year, They’re now deciding on us right? We all know it’s programmed, and it’s a race of the spammers trying to get over this problem, and the humans, also, trying to solve it.

Sometimes, you still need a few of them to get to it. 

In this case, I like them very much, because they have these extra elements in there. At first, I introduced them as business cards. Maybe, we come to that point in the future when you hand this over like, "Oh, can you read this to me, please?"

[laughter]

Aram:  Then, I blew them up and made objects of them and put them in public space, next to graffiti. It’s very close to tags. It’s access code for certain neighborhoods. If you can read this, you’re not allowed to come. If you can read this, you’re not part of the group, et cetera.

I showed this in different locations. This was in Vienna, 2009. It takes a while to find it down here. 

I, also, made them from aluminum. Because these captcha codes, they’re unique. Everything else on the Web, we copy all the time. We can download. We still know how to do this, of course. Once you use them, they are gone. Statistics that this exact captcha code will appear is super minimal.

A lot of this is more an artistic practice, like unique artifacts. I made them in "Apple Aluminum", sort of eternal. Then, also, a recent one I made for the show in Kassel, a big one, a floor piece, is made from rusted steel. It’s also disappearing, but very slowly over time. 

I think captchas describe very well what’s our relation here. And also, we all know, captchas are not working anymore either, because the computing power becomes bigger and bigger. 

There are some more examples with passwords, et cetera. These systems are not working anymore. 

### Google Portraits ###

The Google Portraits is about the genre of portraits. 

What is a portrait? It used to be paintings. It used to be photography. Today, I would claim that the contemporary portrait is like "When I don’t know you, I Google you, and I get 10 results of you". And this is how we get to know of each other in the first place. It’s very fast, it’s very responsive. It might say a lot, but at the same time, it says nothing.

Also, then, you have name collisions. People with the same names, all this funny stuff going on. 

What I did: I took the search URL and I put it into a semacode, later on into QR codes, and they are hand‑drawn.

I make these hand‑drawn QR codes, which are nothing more than just a search on Google. But it’s a search for a person. I say, this is a portrait. This example was Penelope Umbrico, which is an artist friend from New York City. It’s handmade -- the camera, the software doesn’t really care, because there’s error correction.

The drawing is static, but the actual portrait online keeps changing, depending on the algorithm, depending on what the artist or the portrait person is doing. 

This is a self‑portrait made of thumb prints. 

And, also, most recently, I did this one for a show in Paris. This is an Edward Snowden portrait. 

You can go pretty wild when you level up the error correction. It’s like this technical process. We can read that code ourselves, at the same time. I would say, "Google’s first 10 results", it’s the contemporary portrait of today. 

### Dead Drops ###

Some more. We have Dead Drops which I did in 2010 and for this. I’m going to show a quick video.

[video begins] (21:20)

**Aram:**  *Dead Drops* is an offline, anonymous peer‑to‑peer file‑sharing network, and you can be part of it. (...)

[video ends] (21:55)

Ok, you get the idea. It’s like this offline, file‑sharing network. It’s an open project and everybody can participate. It’s very simple to make your own *Dead Drop* by just embedding your USB drive into a wall and cement it in. You can glue it somewhere.

I started this in 2010, while I was artist in residence at EyeBeam. That’s a media arts center in New York City. Actually, I arrived in the city, I felt sick, I only had two weeks left, and I was like, "Let’s do this little project here."

I made these five *Dead Drops* in New York, posted a picture set on Flickr and wrote a blog post, and it exploded afterwards. 

I’m very much in love with that picture of the data and the USB drive, literally cemented into the wall. It’s the opposite of what we have today, with the Cloud, and everything is connected, everything is controlled. 

You need to go to the place. You don’t know what’s on there, or the Dead Drop might be gone already. I may be dangerous, there may be a virus on there -- everybody’s asking that question. It has all these influences on it, and it’s really, for me, kind of that gesture: you kneel down on the street, and it’s wet and it’s dirty, instead of having like a clean Internet and a clean computer. 

It takes it back very much to the city. You put it into a house and, for me, it turns the whole building into a flash drive. 

And of course it’s anonymous. There’s no IP address. 

I did this in 2010 and it was popular, then, for a year maybe. And it now it’s got popular again, after the summer of Snowden. People making Dead Drops, again, and journalists calling me asking if there was like suspicious material on there. It became a whole different view angle on this. 

These are the first five *Dead Drops* in New York City. This is the website, deaddrops.com, you can go to.

Yesterday, there was 1304 *Dead Drops* being made over the past three years. 

((image: map))

This is a world map of all the *Dead Drops* being made. We zoom in onto Hamburg -- there are quite a lot in Hamburg. 

You need to know, they don’t stay long there. It depends on how you put them, how visible they are, and, of course, it’s public space.

You can also see there's wireless one up here, which is a PirateBox. 

There’s all these single pages for each *Dead Drop*, so you have always three pictures from the location, and the map, and the description. These are pictures from a workshop I recently did in Barcelona. These are some earlier pictures.

[laughter] [applause]
Yeah, there's more coming. I also like this one.

(images of Dead Drop in bottle in the sea)

[laughter] [applause]

The fun part about these open projects, for me, it’s like an art... -- you could even call this an "art performance", because everybody is taking part in it. A lot of these people doing this don’t care if it’s art or not. It’s just fun to do. 

It also has references to Geocaching, of course. Then, there is a reference to the spy game with *Dead Drops* and the hidden stuff in the place. 

People, then, took it further and made all these versions of it. This was a show in Lyon where a graphic design blog put out five Dead Drops, or a bunch of them, and you needed to go to these Dead Drops to see the show, to see the art they produced. 

Also, music bands promoted their albums on it. "You can download our new album on iTunes, but you can get it for free here, when you go there". 

There was tons of press. There were all these variations of the project. It was shown in the MOMA in 2011 at the "Talk To Me Show" where people could connect with their laptop and leave stuff in the MOMA. I made this blog post to encourage all artists to bring their digital files and to upload them and then, you can claim you had art in the MOMA, which is a good thing to have.

### DVD Dead Drop ###

I made my own versions. I don’t have the pictures, but there is PirateBox by David Darts. It’s a pretty big community. I bet there are people from PirateBox here. In France it’s very big. It’s the same idea, it’s wireless for routers. It’s driven on openWRT.

There’s Occupy here. There are all kinds of projects in a similar field. *Dead Swap*, by Dimitri, which was, actually, prior to this project, but it’s the idea to swap USB drives in person. It’s a very interesting field.

For the Museum of Moving Image, I made the "DVD Dead Drop" which was a museum version. It’s only one directional, so you get a burned DVD, but from the building. Again, it’s like this almost deprecated media technology, but you can go in there. You get a DVD in the museum shop and you burn your own DVD. 

It ran for a whole year and it has put monthly curated content on there, like also, from shows to movies to different materials. The whole building has this very little suspicious slit, but it becomes a DVD burning drive, for a medium which kind of is over already. 

What else?

### Open Internet ###

Getting to the more interesting stuff. It’s a performance piece I did in New York, also, while I was there. I had my 3G Hotspot with me, so you could connect to Internet, actually. I had open Internet, but at the same time, also, this was a protest for the open Internet. 

I had funny conversations in this city with people, "Oh, yeah, is this is a new kind of business model?"

At the same time, for me, it was already in that time where Net Neutrality and all these topics really became popular. I made protest signs of them, so you carried the Open Internet or protest for the open Internet. 

((image))

This was shown recently in a show in the Netherlands. 

### How to vacuum form ###

Another piece, which I also showed here two years ago at the Congress, "How to Vacuum Form", is a workshop table.

Vacuum forming is a quite classic technique to form plastic material. All the production design people know this. The lid of your coffee cup is vacuum-formed. I had this workshop, I made these molds and everything to vacuum-form this. 

((image: Guy Fawkes mask))

People at the Congress, in 2012, were invited to vacuum-form their own Guy Fawkes mask.

It was often said on the Web, "Don’t buy these masks. You only pour money into the company who owns the rights". So why not make them ourselves? 

A lot of people saw these versions with paper, printed, I guess. But this was taken very fast, a quick one to make. There are some pictures of the production. It’s like a cast of the mask and then, a mold of the cast again. 

This was at the Congress, 2012.
People could make their own masks and then, also, cut them, customize them. 

Then, there’s a transparent version which is interesting.

[laughter]

Aram:  This whole Anonymous story has, also, ... I don't know if it peaked, there’s still a lot going on. 

((image))

And still you can recognize the person. It’s interesting. 

Then, of course, also...

((image))

Aram:  ...There is the dark side.

[applause]

Aram:  Who’s on the dark side?

[laughter]

Aram:  Can’t be only Tim, right? This was at an opening at the beginning of 2012. And I put them in public space, again, in the context of street art. 

### How to turn code into art? 

I thought this is something fun to talk about here. I make a lot of these DIY projects, like the mask making, et cetera.

This whole DIY movement is a super interesting format. How DIY movies or tutorials become more entertaining than the actual tutorial itself? I’ve done a bunch of them. 

This is the tutorial, "How to Turn Code into Art". Sometimes, there’s very important code. I want to encourage you to print code and to frame it. So here, I’m explaining how to frame: you go to the shop, you buy frames, you put it on the wall, and it’s art, right?

Sometimes you’d think this is how it works, and it is. 

In this case, it’s a very important code. It was already printed by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany, where the CCC disassembled the German government's troyan spy software, and found all these parts in there. There was like a backdoor again, in the backdoor software, illegal one. 

I think this is due to Frank Schirmacher, he really gets the point about many things. They printed this on three spreadsheets in this super important, biggest German newspaper. 

Code is -- well I don’t have to tell you, you know code much better than me -- that's how important code is today, that’s what we learned now all this year. It effects us very, very much. 

I like code as art very much. 

### Greetings from the Internet

Greetings from the Internet is a postcard series I collect. Whenever you travel somewhere, you want to go on WiFi online. "What’s the password?" Then your friend writes it down, and you have this moment when you have to decode again: "Is this a six or is this a G? I can’t really read it." You have to guess the password. 

This moment before you go online. I take pictures, because you always need the code again, for your friend coming. or for your other device. So I had this collection, I thought I’d make this postcard series out of it. Of course, there’s always these errors. 

((Image: Passwords = kittenlove, all lowercase ))

It’s like this awkward moment. 

### 0xE818D7C8

This summer I printed my open PGP code, my public PGP code, hand printed on canvas, making this like a real painting. It’s a very important picture. I’m not going to talk about cryptography, that’s been said already yesterday in the keynote, how important this is. It’s not the salvation to all the problems now, but it's really important.

These moments where the Internet was a nice place to play are definitely over. Encryption is going to be more and more important. 

### Forgot Your Password?

Again, about passwords, "Forgot Your Password?" is an eight volume printed books. In these books, you find 4.7 million clear text passwords from LinkedIn, which got stolen in 2012.

[applause]

**Aram:**  When this is on show, you can try to check if your password is in there. I mean, the whole database was much bigger, there was just a small amount which the hackers dropped in some forums, like *decode this* or *decrypt this*. And people decrypted it. You find a quite big chunk of decrypted passwords. All these services lose their passwords all the time. Again, a system which is not really working anymore.

### "F.A.T. - Free Art & Technology Lab"

I’m going to quickly talk about FAT Lab. It’s an artist group founded by James Powderly and Evan Roth in 2007. I’m part of it since 2009.
It’s very much dedicated to the connection, the sweet spot in between open source and pop culture. It’s very much a philosophy which is derived from the Graffiti Research Lab Evan and James were doing before. It’s a lot about copyright, about these privacy questions online, with an artistic provocative approach. 

This is a book which just came out. You can download it for free on the FAT website, or you can also have it printed.

I’m going to show this one project: In 2010,  we were invited to Transmediale in Berlin, to the media art festival. And we did a whole week of "Fuck Google" projects. There were all kinds of little interventions online, browser plug‑ins, et cetera. We also went in the city with a fake Google car. We were building this camera top there, and mounted all this on the car.

There’s no tech in there, it’s just all mockup, there’s no cameras, nothing recording. 

But the moment you put a Google sticker on your car, you *are* Google, and nobody would doubt it. It was prior to the very big discussion, in Germany, in the summer of 2010, about privacy. 

((37:20 video is playing))

It’s very interesting how it’s super easy to understand for the public. There’s a car going in the country. They’re making pictures of every house, every fence, like my garden. How data is collected and browsers with cookies and all this, it’s so hard to understand and teach people this. At this moment, Google wants to be the power plug in the wall you don’t think about. Ever tried to call someone there? Yeah, I have a problem with my Gmail. It’s just not possible.

These invisible companies, but, the moment there’s a car in the city, it was really quite an experience to drive that car. Everybody is reacting to it. You could just stop in the middle of traffic. Nobody will yell at you, because you’re Google. You get the idea of the impact these companies have. Some other fun projects are coming to an end soon. The Pirate Bay movie came out the beginning of this year. I was lucky to be in the premiere in the cinema.
I also had the idea to make a cam screening version.

[applause]

Aram:  This was my first cam recorded movie. You can download it, there’s interviews up front and also after the movie. This was the best scene in the movie theater. People were yelling really loud. The editor of the movie was sitting right in front of me. I was busy with the duct tape the whole show. You can download it as a torrent of course. It’s also on YouTube. This is stuff I made for FAT Lab. The fuck 3D glasses were 2009. Avatar was out.

[applause]

Aram:  All these little projects, very fast projects doing on FAT Labs is a lot of fun. In June, Obama was visiting Berlin. This was right two weeks after the first revelations for Snowden. I made this mask. Of course, Obama never wore the Google glass before. We all know what’s going to happen when all this technology comes in place. There’s a prism in the front.
Who has access to the data, of course it’s recording all the time to improve the service. I took this in the city and also got it into the media, and made some nice tweets about it. Obama is visiting the Stasi Museum. This was quite successful online. This was in the show dropping the Internet. This again, I was missing that word before.
It’s a very recent piece. It’s a quote. There’s this famous piece by a Chinese famous artist Ai Weiwei. He’s dropping the urn, this super expensive urn from 5,000 years ago, just dropping it. For me, the innocence of the Internet is over. We all knew that something was going on, but now it’s on a bigger scale. More people get the idea now.
Liz talked yesterday in the morning. She was like, ’’Oh, this is naive to believe in it.’’ That belief in this Internet will change, will make better society, more democracy and all these things, we know it’s not necessarily only due to that. It depends on us. It’s also the sub‑line of a talk, how to make art after Snowden, there’s a lot of these projects which go to the topic. Right now, after this revelation of the summer, I feel numb, ’’Oh, shit, what should I do now.’’
This is so big. Do you do a fun FAT project? It’s not touching it, really. Also, I don’t have an answer for that question yet. Of course, there needs to be more time. I think on the technology level, there’s the most interesting stuff now happening.
There’s now a lot of art in that field, too. The angle of prior projects, the perspective people see them has changed, which is interesting. What I said about Dead Drop. People really see it in a different light today. Last but not least, this was my very first show, let’s say. I started making art after school, about the beginning of 2000. Maybe I make art, and maybe not. Then there was Blinkenlights, which I love very much.
You probably all know this, attack the facade project, for the 20th birthday of the CCC in 2001. Then there was the Blinken Area, which is still downstairs. Actually, I showed my first art work, let’s say in a show, right here in the window. I was inspired. We were inspired by Blinkenlights and its brilliance.
I made this analog screen, which was driven by a punch card system. There’s a punch board where you can program the screen. I don’t give you much time to understand this now, but there’s 64 tracks on the paper, which control the 64 pixels in the field. You can program them. There’s a super short movie to get an idea. The light in the back is a constant light, there’s no electronic circuits going on.
It’s just a Christmas tea candle chain. Just the holes on the punch card give free way to the light to shine through there. It’s sort of like what the piano, and all the other weaving, but as a screen. Sort of, reinvented the screen as it never has been invented, that’s the last piece I’m showing. Random screen in 2005 at the congress, but also I showed it in many shows afterwards.
It’s pixels that are blinking very randomly. The pixel itself is very much a digital language to us. When you see them, it’s the icon of digital. It’s funny, today when you show this to kids they will say it’s Minecraft. When you look on the backside, you will notice that all these pixels, each pixel is controlled by a tea candle light. It has a spinning beer can on top, which is rotating by the rising heat. There’s only fire on the back.
[applause]
Aram:  This very much illustrates what I like to talk about, these two sides. I show this in a show and a tech guy from another piece asked me how I controlled all these little motors in there, like, ’’Wait, there’s no motors in there.’’ We really have the technology thinking for these events. I think this is the talk. I’m doing a workshop upstairs. It’s based on this mobile phone blocking pouch, which I also did in 2003.
There’s a lot of products out there already. You can come upstairs. I will open up afterwards in foyer D2G. You can make your own mobile phone blocking pouch from this copper cloth material. This is my website. Find me on Twitter. Thank you.
[applause]

Male Host:  Thank you for your great show. We still have some time to take some questions. There are microphones in the aisles. Also, there is a signal angel who’s been monitoring the IRC and Twitter. Any questions, anywhere?

Audience Member:  I would like to ask whatever would make sense concerning the dead drops, because they are broken down often enough. I have seen that in the past. Would it make sense to create wireless dead drops?
Aram:  Yeah. There are wireless dead drops. It was not in the slide show. I don’t know, for some reason. There is PirateBox.
[laughter]
Aram:  Now you know what I’m watching.
[laughter]
Aram:  Which is made by David Darts, we also made a workshop together a year or two years ago. There’s all these wireless versions of it. It’s out there, just search for PirateBox. There’s the library version.
There’s a whole bunch of people coding for the OpenWrt field routers. All the tech people always say use a cable. You won’t break it. For me, it was very important. If you plug in your laptop, hot‑wired to the building, they’re not lasting long, but at the same time, also, it’s super easy to make. Kids make them. You buy them for five bucks. You put them in the wall, done.
TorrentFreak wrote about it. Oh yeah, it’s a cool project. It’s not very efficient though, for file sharing. You don’t know what’s on there. You have to go to the place. It might be broken.
Audience Member:  OK, thank you.
Aram:  It’s symbolic. For me, it’s very symbolic.
Male Host:  Next question, please.
Audience Member:  I’m a little bit irritated. After subtitling how to make art after Snowden, most of the art you show was before Snowden. Was it just a catchy subtitle? Do you really think, what happened would change art in the future? Do you think it’s just not so much fun anymore?
Aram:  It’s a good question. That’s why I talked about these three pictures. There’s no proper answer to it. Art is always a mirror of society. It takes time to see how odd reacted to this.
Tonight there’s a talk by Trevor Paglen. Now there’s all these people who have been doing stuff in that field. Now there’s a lot of attention to this coming. Of course, the sub line was a teaser to make you come here, right, a hack. For me it’s a question when this whole thing happened. It also made me sad, the disbelief in all the stuff. I asked this myself.
Audience Member:  What do you think is...?
Aram:  The proper answer? We have to find out.
Audience Member:  No, what do you think...?
[foreign words]
Aram:  Yeah.
[foreign words]
Aram:  The task of the art. Then we can start to discuss about art and its role in society. It’s a very broad topic. It goes from high‑end market to very low‑end Tumblr blogs. People make stuff so much, which is super important, but don’t even consider art. That’s a big question. Do you have an idea for it?
Audience Member:  This Google street view...
Male Host:  Actually, if you would take a conversation with the artist, and meet him some other place. I’ve got a question from the Internet.

Female Host:  First of all, I’m asked to say thank you again for the good night white pride shirt you gave to Kitty. Second, Frost asked how do you make a living? He said perhaps he...

Aram:  To make stuff, like giving talks, getting paid for giving talks, not here. It’s workshops, giving talks, showing art, getting artist fees for showing art, but also selling art. I do the whole wide range of that.
It’s not easy to make a living as an artist. If you want to make money, don’t make art. I don’t make anything on the side. What I showed since 2003, I did a lot of stuff on the side. This was my side project. Now I only make art, but it’s never easy.

Male Host:  There are no more questions. Once again, thank you very much. I overlooked the microphone, I’m so sorry, one question, on microphone one.

Audience Member:  I think we’ve got three minutes. I was wondering about the Google car project. What did you do with that? Was that just for the performance of doing it at the time? I know you showed some video here. Was it documented? Was the point of it just a performance of doing it, or is there more on it? Is there a longer video piece or something?

Aram:  It has different layers. Of course, there’s always when you do performance in public space and they give a video, Window’s video, of it, that’s the only documentation. There’s not always a discussion, it’s the documentation the piece or not? Most people are seeing this as a video and fewer people are seeing it in public space.
You can argue about this and as it’s true for many performance art from over all the decades. In this case, fiber ops work very much online. It started as a hoax, actually, so there was all the big press, "Huffington Post", et cetera. They were like, "Oh, yeah, there’s this tech lab and they’re following the Google call in Germany."
It really started as a hoax online and a few days later, was uncovered. Of course, it’s, also, when you work with Google, and Google car. The idea was to make stuff with Google car which they wouldn’t do and don’t want to see it in that kind of light, at the same time you, there was a while driving that car, it was kind of scary. Everybody was like, "Oh yeah the Google car", being enthusiastic about it. Also, as an artist it’s important when you make these things. You’re on a thin line too, very important how you make this.

Male Host:  One last question.
Audience Member:  My question is also about the Google car and about being critical. I am a little bit surprised that you said that Snowden was such a big shock, because I knew you as being critical against capitalism, and surveillance, and can you just describe a little bit what was the shock?

Aram:  Yes. That’s a discussion I also already mentioned, it was this. It was like. It was mentioned over the past months. One said "Oh we all knew, this was nothing new, Why you freaking out" On the other hand a lot of people, for a lot of people it’s new.
It’s so important that this happened and it’s really good, of course. But, as my work is in all these thing and as I also showed in beginning. That is what I said about the names above our heads. I was talking about, thinking about digital online and offline, et cetera, and now it’s so close it’s already here. All the info is out there. They have all the data to just make this and it becomes so scary. That’s the experience what kind of makes me so much think about it. It’s not so supper shocking news.
Male Host:  Thank you for attending. If you like this talk, you can rate it on the conference wiki, or actually the Pentabarf. I ask you to leave the room. Please take everything you brought in with you. That includes anything that might have transformed into trash and empty bottles. Thank you.
